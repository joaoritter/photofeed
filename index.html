    DESCRIPTION:
    This website is a minimalistic way for photographers to tell stories via their photographs. As the site pulls photos from a web service, 
    it lazily compacts them to the gallery, creating an unbalanced composition. On larger screens, the gallery strategically chooses the photo's size
    at runtime; this means that on every refresh, photos may be assigned a different size. Since the gallery is formed at runtime, having different 
    sizes means the gallery will be curated differently each time the page is loaded. The result is a clean and delightfully unpredictable
    tour of an artist's photographs.

    PLUGINS USED:
    I made use of a wonderful plugin 'Stalactite' by Jono Brandel. I editted the plugin to allow it to support clean row transitions and 
    multi-width elements, two features that are vital to this site's display mechanism.
